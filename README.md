# Beyond Surface Statistics: Scene Representations in a Latent Diffusion Model
Linear probes found controllable representations of scene attributes in a text-to-image diffusion model

## Replicate
Clone the repository with "git clone https://github.com/karinaechen/diffusion-model-internal-representation"
Go to the repository directory with "cd diffusion-model-internal-representation"

### Using pip environment
pip install -r requirements.txt

## Probe Weights:
Unzip the [probe_checkpoints.zip](https://github.com/karinaechen/diffusion-model-internal-representation/blob/main/probe_checkpoints.zip) to acquire all probe weights. The probe weights in the unzipped folder should be sufficient for you to run all experiments.
